Numerical homogenization for porous material using FFT method

This repository contains the Matlab source codes to solve various problems involving porous media, based on Lippmann Schwinger integral equations and Fast Fourier Transform

Homogenization is the procedure of finding the overall behavior of heterogeneous materials from their microstructures by solving the boundary value problems in a unit cell called Representative elementary volume (REV). The local behavior of the problem are characterized by Partial Differential Equations (PDE) with varying coefficients representing the heterogeneity of the material. Depending on the physics, it could be heat conduction, elasticity, plasticity or Stokes flow etc.. problems at the local scale.
